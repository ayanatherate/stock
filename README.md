# Predicting Stock Prices of NSE:FEDERALBNK using CNN-LSTM's.

<h5> Being new to stock market trading, tried to see if CNN-LSTM's can help me make some &#128176; lol.  <br> <br>
Used the model to have a (rough) estimate of the closing prices of the same, 7 days forward. Also, wrote a function that estimates profit/loss margin from day of stock buy to current date. </h5>

<h6> PS: No special reason for choosing Federal Bank. Was following the stock for a number of days and was thus interested. </h6>
